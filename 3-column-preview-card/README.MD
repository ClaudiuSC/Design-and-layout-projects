FrontEnd-Mentor.
These are projects using the designs from https://www.frontendmentor.io. This is a website that challenges you to build websites that sharpen your development skills.

This is a 3 column preview card with cards that have the following: images, headers, paragraphs and buttons. 
I used flexbox to align the cards and their content and i stylized the buttons using borders, border-radius, background-color and color and applied changes on hover effect. 
I also made the cards responsive by changing the flex-direction.

BBQ landing page with with a register form.

It features gradients on text, using text clip, on a button and on an ::after pseudo element which was used to simulate a border(i later learned that there is a border-image property which can be used to acomplish this).

Another special feature for this page is a background image which i applied on an ::after pseudo element in order to apply opacity to it, this way not affecting the content of the section. I used a background color with rgba to make blend the image with the color(could have used background blend mode but this worked as well).

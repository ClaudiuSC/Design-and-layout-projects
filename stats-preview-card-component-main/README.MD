Responsive preview card.

Mobile first.

I used the "img" tag to display the pictures and used the "display: none;" property to switch between the mobile and desktop versions.

Note: the method used to switch pictures should be avoided because the browser fetches both files => use srcset on picture or background-image with @media query.
